This chapter deals with absolute number fields and orders there of. 

## Definitions and vocabulary

We begin by collecting the necessary definitions and vocabulary. 
This is in particular important for everything related to embeddings of number fields into archimedean fields, since they are at least two (slighlty) different normalizations. 

### Number fields

By an absolute number field we mean finite extensions of $\mathbf Q$, which is
of type `AnticNumberField` and whose elements are of type `nf_elem`. Such an
absolute number field $K$ is always given in the form $K = \mathbf Q(\alpha) =
\mathbf Q[X]/(f)$, where $f \in \mathbf Q[X]$ is an irreducible polynomial.
See [here](@ref NumberFieldsLink) for more information on the different
types of fields supported.

We
call $(1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\dotsc,\alpha^{d-1})$, where $d$ is the degree $[K :
\mathbf Q]$ the *power basis* of $K$. If $\beta$ is any element of $K$, then
the *representation matrix* of $\beta$ is the matrix representing $K \to K,
\gamma \mapsto \beta \gamma$ with respect to the power basis, that is,

```math
\beta \cdot (1,\alpha,\dotsc,\alpha^{d-1}) = M_\alpha (1, \alpha, \dotsc, \alpha^{d-1}).
```

Let $(r,s)$ be the signature of $K$, that is, $K$ has $r$ real embeddings $\sigma_i \colon K \to \mathbf{R}$, $1 \leq i \leq r$, and $2s$ complex embeddings $\sigma_i \colon K \to \mathbf{C}$, $1 \leq i \leq 2s$.
In Hecke the complex embeddings are always ordered such that $\sigma_i = \overline{\sigma_{i+s}}$ for $r + 1 \leq i \leq r + s$.
The $\mathbf{Q}$-linear function
```math
K \longrightarrow \mathbf R^{d}, \ \alpha \longmapsto (\sigma_1(\alpha),\dotsc,\sigma_r(\alpha),\sqrt{2}\operatorname{Re}(\sigma_{r+1}(\alpha)),\sqrt{2}\operatorname{Im}(\sigma_{r+1}(\alpha)),\dotsc,\sqrt{2}\operatorname{Re}(\sigma_{r+s}(\alpha)),\sqrt{2}\operatorname{Im}(\sigma_{r+s}(\alpha))
```
is called the *Minkowski map* (or *Minkowski embedding*).

### Orders

If $K = \mathbf Q(\alpha)$ is an absolute number field, then an *order* $\mathcal
O$ of $K$ is a subring of the ring of integers $\mathcal O_K$, which is free
of rank $[ K : \mathbf Q]$ as a $\mathbf Z$-module. The natural order $\mathbf
Z[\alpha]$ is called the *equation order* of $K$. In Hecke orders of absolute
number fields are constructed (implicitely) by specifying a $\mathbf Z$-basis,
which is refered to as the *basis* of $\mathcal O$. If
$(\omega_1,\dotsc,\omega_d)$ is the basis of $\mathcal O$, then the matrix $B
\in \operatorname{Mat}_{d \times d}(\mathbf Q)$ with

```math
\begin{pmatrix} \omega_1 \\\\ \vdots \\\\ \omega_d \end{pmatrix} = B \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \vdots \\\\ \alpha^{d - 1} \end{pmatrix}
```

is called the *basis matrix* of $\mathcal O$. We call $\det(B)$ the *generalized
index* of $\mathcal O$.  In case $\mathbf Z[\alpha] \subseteq \mathcal O$, the
determinant $\det(B)^{-1}$ is in fact equal to $[ \mathcal O : \mathbf Z[\alpha]]$
and is called the *index* of $\mathcal O$.
The matrix
```math
\begin{pmatrix} 
\sigma_1(\omega_1) & \dotsc & \sigma_r(\omega_1) & \sqrt{2}\operatorname{Re}(\sigma_{r+1}(\omega_1)) & \sqrt{2}\operatorname{Im}(\sigma_{r+1}(\omega_1)) & \dotsc & \sqrt{2}\operatorname{Im}(\sigma_{r+s}(\omega_1)) \\\\
\sigma_1(\omega_2) & \dotsc & \sigma_r(\omega_2) & \sqrt{2}\operatorname{Re}(\sigma_{r+1}(\omega_2)) & \sqrt{2}\operatorname{Im}(\sigma_{r+1}(\omega_2)) & \dotsc  & \sqrt{2}\operatorname{Im}(\sigma_{r+s}(\omega_2)) \\\\
\vdots & \dotsc & \vdots & \vdots & \dotsc & \vdots & \vdots\\\\
\sigma_1(\omega_d) & \dotsc & \sigma_r(\omega_d) & \sqrt{2}\operatorname{Re}(\sigma_{r+1}(\omega_d)) & \sqrt{2}\operatorname{Im}(\sigma_{r+2}(\omega_d)) & \dotsc & \sqrt{2}\operatorname{Im}(\sigma_{r+s}(\omega_d))
\end{pmatrix}
\in \operatorname{Mat}_{d\times d}(\mathbf R).
```
is called the *Minkowski matrix* of $\mathcal O$.


## Examples

Usually, to create an order, one starts with a field (or a polynomial):

```@repl 1
using Hecke; # hide
Qx, x = PolynomialRing(FlintQQ, "x");
K, a = NumberField(x^2 - 10, "a");
E = EquationOrder(K)
Z_K = MaximalOrder(K)
conductor(E)
E == Z_K
```

Once orders are created, we can play with elements and ideals:

```@repl 1
lp = prime_decomposition(Z_K, 2)
p = lp[1][1]
isprincipal(p)
fl, alpha = isprincipal(p^2)
norm(alpha)
```

It is possible to work with residue fields as well:

```@repl 1
Fp, mFp = ResidueField(Z_K, p)
[ mFp(x) for x = basis(Z_K)]
```
